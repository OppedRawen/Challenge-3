# Password Generation project
For this week project, we were given starter code where I built a password generating algorithm on. I utilized tools such as variables, if else statements, and for loops to complete this assignment
# Steps
1. Create prompts that ask users for password criteria selections
2. Create logic that prevent users from entering the wrong statement
3. Generate a password with the prompts given
# Additional steps
1. Javascript page is well documented
2. Include a readme file
